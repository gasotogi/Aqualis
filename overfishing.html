              Fish play a crucial role as they feed on carbon in the form of phytoplankton at the ocean's surface and subsequently excrete this carbon into the depths of the oceans, where it is retained. Therefore, overfishing has the potential to worsen our climate situation as it negatively impacts the oceans' ability to serve as carbon sinks, which help regulate the climate by removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Hence, the preservation of marine ecosystems and sustainable fisheries management are critical for mitigating climate change.

            <u> Take less than nature does.<br></u>
<br>We recommend setting catch limits of fish at half the
number of fish that die naturally (the natural mortality
rate). Fish die naturally from predation, disease, natural
hazards, and old age.<br>

<br> <u>Keep population sizes to larger than half of
what they would be naturally <br></u>
<br>Fishing shouldn’t reduce fish populations to below half
of their natural levels (the levels they had before we
started fishing them). If populations fall below this level,
ecosystems may become unstable as the fish can’t carry
out their roles as prey or predators<br>

<br> <u> Let fish grow and make baby fish<br></u>
<br>We should allow individual fish within a population to
grow and reproduce before we catch them. Fish usually
reproduce when they have grown close to 2/3rd of their
maximum size. We call this the Optimum Length. We
recommend modifying fishing gear so that on average,
fish can reach the Optimum Length.
We carried out this study to test the effectiveness of
these three rules.<br>
<br>
<u>Sustainable fish traps</u> are fishing methods aimed at minimizing environmental impact and ensuring responsible fishing,
          <br> allowing for the conservation of fish populations and the maintenance of the health of aquatic ecosystems. These traps are designed to be selective,
            <br>reducing accidental catch of non-target species and juvenile fish, as well as limiting damage to marine habitats.
